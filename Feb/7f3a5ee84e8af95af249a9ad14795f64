Quickmart Supermarket branch on Waiyaki Way, Nairobi. PHOTO | SALATON NJAU Quickmart Supermarket has opened a new branch in Kitengela as part of its ongoing expansion plan. The outlet will on Friday open the outlet at OBC Kitengela Mall, targeting hundreds of shoppers around the region. The new store, located in an area that’s currently served by retailers such as Naivas and Eastmatt will be Quickmart’s first in the town and the 48th outlet countrywide. “The [new]store is located at OBC Kitengela Mall as you exit the main Kitengela town towards Namanga,” said Quickmart’s marketing director Betty Wamaitha yesterday. “The store will feature prominently our fresh sections; deli, bakery, butchery, fresh fruits, vegetables, foods, personal care, homecare, textiles, electronics and household goods.” The expansion is part of a new generation of retailers seeking to fill the void left by the collapse of former giants Nakumatt Holdings and Tuskys. Nakumatt went into administration in 2018 after it was unable to pay billions of shillings owed to suppliers, banks and debt investors. Tuskys followed suit, losing nearly all its stores after defaulting on suppliers and other creditors. Tuskys, until recently Kenya’s top retailer with 53 stores, has less than 10 outlets operating amid stock-outs. It is seeking to sell a majority stake to a consortium made up of a private equity firm and an undisclosed foreign retailer as part of efforts to raise cash to pay suppliers and win back their confidence. Quickmart, Carrefour and Naivas are among the retailers currently expanding across the country. Naivas has stepped up its expansion drive after receiving Sh6 billion from a consortium of investors for a 30 percent stake. botieno@ke.nationmedia.com
