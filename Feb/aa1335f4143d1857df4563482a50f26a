The Bill proposed by sponsored by Nambale MP Sakwa Bunyasi had sought to usurp the powers of the CBK as a fiscal agent and banker to the government. MPs have agreed to drop the proposal after the CBK Governor Dr Patrick Njoroge protested, arguing that the functions are critical to it’s effectiveness in other functions and importantly, coordination of monetary and fiscal policies, managing the exchange rate, lender of last resort to the banking sector and regulator of the National Payment System. The Governor said taking away this function will weaken CBK and overall economic management but also place those responsibilities in an organ that does not capacity to deliver. The change would also have denied CBK income since it earns a commission of 1.5 per cent of amounts raised through its agency role in the issuance of Treasury bills and bonds. However, the annual commission income is limited to Sh3 billion as per the agreement between the Bank and The National Treasury effective 1st July, 2007. MPs have made the right decision to keep the roles at CBK due to its expertise and capacity as well as ensuring CBK is still able to deliver on its other roles in coordinating economic management. The bank should however see this as an opportunity to improve its fiscal role to find ways of making state borrowing cheaper and democratize domestic debt away from domination by bankers.
