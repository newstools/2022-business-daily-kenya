The company has announced that it will start offering internet services in Ongata Rongai and Ngong areas from mid this month with customers paying a monthly fee of Sh1,500 monthly for a speed of 4Mbps with no cap. Demand for internet has been growing exponentially especially in the low and middle-income areas with low penetration of fiber connectivity, creating a huge opportunity for startups to fill. “We are currently building our network into several new areas including Ngong and Ongata Rongai,” the company says on its website. The internet company is also planning to expand its street and home internet networks to Nairobi and adjacent areas such as Banana, Athi River, Fedha, Kamulu, Kiserian, Kikuyu, Utawala, Kitengela, Limuru, Thika, among others. Only in December last year, the company expanded its services to Donholm as well as Umoja, both in Nairobi. Already, the firm provides internet services in areas such as Githurai 44 and 45, Huruma, Kawangware, Kasarani, Uthiru, Zimmerman, among others. In January, the firm raised $28 million (Sh3.1 billion) from Africa50, a financing vehicle backed by the African Development Bank (AfDB) and African countries for expansions. The latest funding now raises its total fundraising raised so far to $36 million (Sh4 billion). kvnrotich@gmail.com
