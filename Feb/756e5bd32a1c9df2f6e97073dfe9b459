President Uhuru Kenyatta. PHOTO | PSCU President Uhuru Kenyatta did well to reject a Bill that seeks to have depositors of collapsed banks wait for six months before they can be compensated. Mr Kenyatta has written a memorandum asking MPs to delete a section introducing a new provision to the Kenya Deposit Insurance Act to prescribe the six-month waiting period. It will now take 233 MPs or a two-thirds majority of the House to overturn the President’s memo. We ask lawmakers to let the President’s input prevail. It is absurd to have depositors wait for six months before they receive compensation when the sums in question — now to be raised to Sh1 million per customer — are insured. The guaranteed deposits per customer will be increased from the current Sh500,000, which was itself a jump from the previous Sh100,000 that was in place for decades until July 2020. The Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation collects premiums, running into billions of shillings, from banks every year for the express purpose of making a minimum compensation to depositors of failed institutions. Given that bank failures are rare and there will likely be enough money to pay the guaranteed deposits, priority should be on prompt payments to build confidence in the financial system when crises occur. There appears to be no justification for the proposed waiting period, during which time depositors will suffer financially. Parliament should not put up a fight to reinstate this bad idea.
