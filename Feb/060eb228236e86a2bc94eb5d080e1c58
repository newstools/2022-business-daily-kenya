The mounting legal bill for torture, constitutional violations, contract breaches, unlawful dismissals and fees has hit Sh1.2 trillion, a colossal sum for a government already struggling to meet other expenditure. The value of legal suits is equivalent of 71 percent of the country’s annual taxes or the equivalent of Kenya’s total debt to the World Bank. Some of these huge bills can be attributed to irresponsible decisions and abuse of power by public officials. Others arose from suits filed by victims of torture who won multimillion-shilling court awards, failure to honor contractual obligations to companies, arbitrary termination of employment and weak State defence teams. Public officials need to bear some responsibility for the litigation costs incurred by the State to reduce the amounts of court awards. The tendency for officials to have a laissez-faire attitude in making unlawful decisions should stop and those culpable need to be penalised accordingly. The government must also improve the rate of settling the court awards since they attract interest, adding more costs. Victims of torture in previous regimes awarded millions of shillings for the suffering they underwent decades ago are yet to be paid.
