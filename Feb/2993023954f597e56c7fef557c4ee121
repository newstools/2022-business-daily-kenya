In a ruling delivered by Gauteng High Court in Pretoria, the judge found that the telecom giant shortchanged the service inventor Nkosana Makate. The “Please Call Me” function allows Vodacom and its subsidiaries’ callers in 32 countries, including Kenya, to notify the recipients through a text message to call them back. The compensation amount is much higher than what Vodacom had offered in a settlement after the Constitutional Court ruled in Mr Makate’s favour in 2019. The inventor described last week’s judgment as a “big relief”. He had rejected an earlier Vodacom settlement and instead sought a court review. Although the giant telecom, which has deployed the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) function across its platforms, offered Mr Makate Sh345 million (R47 million), the court termed the offer as far too conservative. “Vodacom CEO was disingenuous to project that Please Call Me as a third-party service provider should only be allocated duration of five years,” the judge said. The judge noted that projecting the service as a brilliant concept would have had the longevity it has today. The court ruled in favour of Mr Makate, who had proposed that he be compensated for the years the service has been in use, saying it is reasonable and probable. The court ordered that Mr Makate be paid five percent of the total voice revenue generated over a 20-year period, from March 2001 to March 2021. Vodacom said it would appeal.
