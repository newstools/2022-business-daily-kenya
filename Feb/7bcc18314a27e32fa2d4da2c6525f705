FILE PHOTO | NMG A 40-megawatt (MW) solar plant being built in Eldoret has secured a fifteen-year $35 million (Sh3.9 billion) loan from the Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund (EAIF). EAIF is backed by the governments of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Sweden. The financing will be directed towards the development of the Kesses solar park project, whose construction is scheduled to be completed by December, the fund said. The project is owned by Alten Kenya Solarfarms BV, the local arm of Spanish headquartered independent power producer Alten Energias Renovables Group, and will require a total investment of $87 million (Sh9.8 billion) for completion. The solar farm’s output will be sold under a 20-year take-or-pay power purchase agreement (PPA) with Kenya Power #ticker:KPLC . “The Kesses plant brings multiple benefits to Kenya’s economic development,” said Sine Zulu, an investment specialist at EAIF’s investment managers Ninety One. “It will also play an important part in combatting climate change and strengthening Kenya’s ability to recover from Covid-19.” The developer has already obtained a portion of the loan, EAIF said. EAIF raises its debt capital from public and private sources, including Allianz, the global insurance and financial services company. Others are Standard Chartered Bank #ticker:SCBK , African Development Bank, German development finance institution KFW and Dutch development bank FMO. President Uhuru Kenyatta last September ordered the cancellation of all ongoing and incomplete power purchase agreements being negotiated with the State distributor Kenya Power. bnjoroge@ke.nationmedia.com
