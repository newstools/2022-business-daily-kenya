FILE PHOTO | NMG The disclosure that the Treasury diverted Sh2.074 billion fuel subsidy cash to other State agencies in breach of the law, for a second time, is worrying. The Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu says an unnamed private firm and four other State agencies in the energy sector, which have no responsibility in the oil and petroleum industry, were the beneficiaries of the latest diversion. Worse yet, officials failed to submit documents to her office, showing how the funds were used by these entities. This frustrates the work of the Auditor-General, whose mandate is to oversight the use of public resources for accountability purposes. The Treasury should be setting the standards for good public finance practices. If it, however, ends up as the weakest link, how should we expect other State agencies to steward public resources? Granted, the Treasury can reallocate resources to emerging priority areas, but that should be done transparently with the necessary checks from Parliament to ensure funds are not taken away from other critical expenditure items. MPs must fast-track the review of the laws governing the petroleum industry to establish an independent body to manage the fuel subsidy fund. This will ensure that the fund does what it was set to do — to cushion consumers from high fuel prices.
