PHOTO | AFP Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Raychelle Omamo has denied disobeying a court order directing the government to issue Kenyan born lawyer Miguna Miguna with emergency travel documents in November last year. Ms Omamo says in reply to an application by Dr Miguna, seeking to send her to civil jail for six months that Kenyan missions in Germany and Canada, have been waiting for the exiled lawyer to show up so that he could get the documents. Dr Miguna said in the application that went to Berlin on November 22 and 23, last year that he was not issued with the documents as directed by the court. The CS says that by then, the ministry and the Attorney General had not been served with the court order, and the deputy head of mission and other staff could not issue him with the emergency travel documents when he sought them. “That since 24th November 2021, the date of the service of the order upon the Attorney General, the Kenya Missions in Berlin and Ottawa have remained at the disposal of the applicant but the applicant has not returned to seek the Emergency Travel Documents,” she said in an affidavit. Dr. Miguna is also seeking compensation of $10,000 (about Sh1.1 million) from the government, being the financial losses incurred during his aborted trip from Canada to Kenya in November last year. He wants Ms Omamo found in contempt of the order issued on November 22, which required him to obtain emergency travel documents from any Embassy or High Commission within 72 hours. skiplagat@ke.nationmedia.com
