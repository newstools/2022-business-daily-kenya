On Monday, a former National Social Security Fund (NSSF) investment manager and officials of a collapsed stock brokerage firm were fined a total of Sh9.6 billion over the loss of Sh1.2 billion at the pensions fund over a decade ago. A former finance and administration manager at Water Resource Management Authority (Warma) was on Tuesday found guilty of soliciting and receiving bribes from his junior officers based in regional offices so that he could release funds for development and running operations at the units. The court ordered him to pay a fine of Sh7.6 million or serve 24 years in prison. Corruption has become so ingrained that individuals, both in the public and private sectors, have lost a sense of guilt about their thieving ways. The impact of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, which imposes a mandatory fine of twice the amount one benefited from or the loss occasioned, is now being felt. For the war to be won, the criminal justice system must continue to crack the whip, and the punishment must be made insufferable to serve as a deterrent.
