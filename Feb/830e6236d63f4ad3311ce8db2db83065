Kenya has joined 26 other countries that have a country-specific 2050 emissions calculator. Kenya is the first in East Africa to benefit from this initiative, at a funding of £173,000 (Sh27 million). During the launch on 16th November 16, 2021, Mike Foster, Head of Prosperity and Climate at the British High Commission Nairobi, linked the project to Kenya’s commitment to meeting her nationally determined contributions (NDCs). He said the Kenya 2050 Calculator project will enable policy-makers to understand different options to reduce emissions and make decisions backed by data.” Isaac Kiva, the Renewable Energy Secretary at the Ministry of Energy, said the Calculator was essential especially since Kenya has been adversely affected by the extreme effects of climate change. He gave his commitment towards working at achieving net-zero emissions in the COP21-Paris Agreement. The UK’s International 2050 Calculator programme supports low- and middle-income countries in accelerating their sustainability and decarbonisation agenda. It can also be used by governments and various stakeholders and the public to understand how to decarbonise a country. The Kenya project will help the country to come up with the Kenya Carbon Emission Reduction Tool – KCERT 2050. And it is being managed by the Ministry of Energy and the British High Commission in Nairobi. The project is meant to help countries meet the ambitious net-zero target by 2050. The calculator projects emissions generated or abated across a span of 35 years, resulting from various activities in the electricity generation and distribution, industrial, transport, buildings, farming and forestry sectors, among others. It gives policymakers an opportunity to simulate various intervention scenarios and the outcomes. The tool can thus be used by businesses, NGOs, and government strategists to show how changes in lifestyle, food demand and supply, technology, fuel, and land use could impact on emissions and climate change.
