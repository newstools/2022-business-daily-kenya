The City Hall building in Nairobi. FILE PHOTO | NMG Bar owners and liquour traders in Nairobi look set to get a relief after the county assembly proposed halving of licence fees. This follows a call by the traders to City Hall to review the charges, arguing that they had made the cost of business staggeringly high especially taking a massive hit from Covid related restrictions. Currenly, liquour traders pay Sh50,000 for an annual licence and Sh30,000 for a six-month permit. However, the Budget and Appropriations Committee has proposed amendments to the Nairobi County Finance Bill, 2021 which will see traders pay as little as Sh15,000. For off licence, the amendment will see the charges reduced from Sh24,000 annually to Sh12,000 and Sh7,000 for a six-month licence, down from the current charge of Sh14,000. The Budget committee chairperson Robert Mbatia said that the liquour traders, through the Bar Owners Association, made their case for the fee cut during a public participation meeting into the Finance Bill. “The association took the committee through the painful journey of opening or operating a bar or a wines and spirit shop. In this regard, the committee has proposed that the relevant charges be reduced by 50 percent,” said Mr Mbatia. Bars and restaurants were among businesses hardest hit by long covid closure at the height of the pandemic. Some are yet to reopen even after restrictions were lifted last October. The new development follows traders complaints about harassment by different authorities despite compliance with regulations. The Bar Hotels Liquor Traders Association chairperson Simon Njoroge said county government enforcement and police officers were extorting them on a daily basis and despite numerous complaints, authorities have been slow to address their grievances. comulo@ke.nationmedia.com
