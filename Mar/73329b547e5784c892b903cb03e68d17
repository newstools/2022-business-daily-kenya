The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has asked the High Court to compel Evans Nyaoka Rambeka to return a three-year Sh3,162,452 salary it said he earned on the strength of forged academic certificates. However, Mr Rambeka who is serving a one-year jail term for forging academic papers told Justice Esther Maina that he is not to blame for securing the job which he has done competently. Through his lawyer Danstan Omari, he urged the court to dismiss the EACC application saying he did not forge any of the two certificates, including a Diploma in Human Resource Management from the Kenya Institute of Management. Mr Omari told the court when his client sought employment he did not have any papers but was considered for the Job. "If the employer decided to employ me without academic qualifications, l am not to blame," Mr Rambeka stated. rmunguti@ke.nationmedia.com
