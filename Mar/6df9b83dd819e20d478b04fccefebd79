Milimani Law Court in Nairobi. PHOTO | DENNIS ONSONGO | NMG A Kiambu trader was charged with possession of excisable goods attached with counterfeit excise stamps at the Milimani Law Court. The trader, Peter Kamau Mburu appeared before Chief Magistrate Wendy Micheni on account of the possession of counterfeit excise stamps which is illegal under the Excise Duty Act. The accused denied the charges and was granted bond. “Police officers from Kiambu police station arrested the accused on 15th March 2022 within Kiambu town upon receiving a tip-off that he was in possession of 51 cartons containing 1018 pieces of Aquila Vodka affixed with counterfeit excise stamps aboard motor vehicle registration number KG 8505,” KRA said in a statement. The incident comes after the Kenya Revenue Authority rolled out new generation excise stamps in a bid to reduce illicit trade in the country. Meanwhile, Brian Agol Banda was on 11th March 2022 arraigned before the judge to answer to charges of forgery of a KRA VIP parking sticker. KRA officers conducted a crackdown in February on motor vehicle bearing KRA VIP parking stickers and discovered that sticker number NCCA 26/HON/2021 affixed on motor vehicle registration number KCV 163V Toyota Aqua was fake and that parking fees had not been paid. The suspect pleaded not guilty to the offences and was granted cash bail. emwenda@ke.nationmedia.com
