KBL Managing Director John Musunga said the new beer brand will continue to become more popular, proportionate to consumers’ gravitation towards healthier choices and tastes. “It is important to innovate against unmet needs for our customers, moderators, occasional consumers and abstainers by offering a credible low and non-alcoholic option into their drinks’ repertoire,” said Mr Musunga. KBL acting Marketing and Innovations Director Anne Joy Michira said the new beer targets drinkers who looking for an upgrade while sticking to a brand they’re familiar with.
