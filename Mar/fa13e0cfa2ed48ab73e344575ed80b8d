Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya said the Sh17 billion project is back on course after being hit by funding delays and is now 95 percent complete. The Kenya Leather Park (KLP) will be the major employer in the region. The leather park is sitting on a 500-acre land that includes 14 tanneries and an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). The National government-funded project is under the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Cooperatives, through Kenya Leather Development Council (KLDC)and the Export Processing Zones Authority (EPZA) as implementing agencies. CS Munya said the structures are complete and machines installed. "The government is focused on hides and skins value addition. The leather park has a capacity to produce 10 million shoes and other leather accessories annually targeting the global market," Mr Munya said, noting that the two-month delay of the project was due to shortage of funds following the Covid-19 pandemic s. Mr Munya said livestock farmers will benefit from the park which will provide a competitive market for hides and skins, some of which are currently going to waste. The leather park has the capacity to handle 150 tonnes of raw hides daily. He said with the completion of the stores, the government is now looking for investors to occupy the available space. Investors at the park will enjoy incentives extended to investors operating within EPZ. sngotho@ke.nationmedia.com
