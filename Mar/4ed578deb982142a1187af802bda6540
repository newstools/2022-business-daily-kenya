The electricity distributor, however, faces the challenge of ensuring availability of power in light of the frequent outages seen across the country. “For Kenya Power, the e-mobility evolution provides us with an inorganic opportunity to grow sales,” Kenya Power acting CEO Rosemary Oduor said on Wednesday during the launch of electric vehicle start-up BasiGo’s Sh5 million bus. “Kenya presently has an installed capacity of 2,991 megawatts (MW), and an off-peak load of 1,200 MW. This means that there is enough power to support the entire e-mobility ecosystem, including powering charging stations for domestic and business use.” She added that Kenya Power can supply electricity to charge 50,000 buses and two million motorcycles during off-peak hours. This is based on the company’s estimates that an electric minibus operating within Nairobi covers approximately 200km daily and consumes an average of 120 kilowatt-hours (kWh) at a cost of Sh2,400. “1,000 mini buses, operating within the city, would therefore consume approximately 120 MWh per day,” Ms Oduor said. The company said it has created a liaison office which will act as a one-stop-shop to champion its e-mobility business. Through the office, Kenya Power will work with other stakeholders to support the development of the e-mobility eco-system, which will include the identification of sites for potential charging stations, as well as requisite geo-mapping software to enable users locate the nearest charging station. kvnrotich@gmail.com
