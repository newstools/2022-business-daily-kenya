Are you super flexible, or have you been called “double-jointed”? Joint Hypermobility is a condition where the soft tissue in the joints has too much elasticity and, therefore, allows the joint to extend beyond a normal range movement. The condition is typically inherited and is fairly common. Being flexible has some obvious benefits, including a natural talent for gymnastics or ballet, but having hypermobile joints has some drawbacks as well when it comes to musculoskeletal injuries. So what does it mean if you have Joint Hypermobility? When connective tissue has too much elasticity, you are at risk of injury because your joints can easily hyper-extend, i.e. extend beyond their normal range of movement. This can lead to repetitive sprains, and even joint dislocations. If you have joint hypermobility, you need to focus on gaining more control of the movement around your joints. This control is gained through strengthening the surrounding muscles through controlled, functional movement. Exercises that focus on stability will help greatly: squats, lunges, balancing exercises, and planks. If you feel you might have hypermobile joints, it is important to be proactive in keeping the muscles surrounding your joints nice and strong. If you experience recurrent sprains in the same location (e.g. ankles), or you have any niggles that just won’t go away, chances are there is a weakness that needs to be addressed. A holistic physiotherapy programme could help to repair any damage and stabilise the area to prevent future injury. This physical therapy helps to: •Reduce pain and the risk of dislocations •Improve muscle strength and fitness • Improve your posture and balance Come and see one of our experienced physiotherapists for a more thorough diagnosis and to make a plan.
