Ongoing construction of the Nairobi Expressway. PHOTO | FILE | NMG The Nairobi Expressway is yet to be opened for trials, the Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) has said. In a statement, the authority said that the Sh88 billion expressway has not been opened to motorists for trials yet. The confirmation comes days after viral reports emerged on social media that the highly anticipated road had been temporarily opened for use, free of charge, until March 31. Some motorists shared video clips while driving on the 27-kilometre road that went viral on social media with some online users claiming that the road had already been opened for the trials ahead of its commissioning by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Others claimed that they had paid a fee to use the road. "Small cars maximum is 360 per trip. The expressway is open Gentlemen! ! Seven minutes from Sameer industrial park to Westy Small cars. Least is around 120. Meaning 360 applies from mlolongo to James gichuru road express. About payment (sic)," a message circulating widely on WhatsApp said. But Kenha has disputed the claims. “Contrary to speculative information circulating in some social media platforms, this is to notify the public that the Nairobi Expressway is not yet open to traffic,” said Kenha said on its official Twitter handle. “As the contractor nears completion, and in preparation for the eventual opening of the road to the public, there will be guided trials to test the operations of the system that has been installed. Being a key road that is expected to decongest the city, the Authority shall inform the public in advance, but at an appropriate time on arrangements to open the road to the public,” the authority added. Once the road is complete, motorists are expected to pay between Sh100 and Sh1,550 in toll charges, depending on the size of the vehicle and the distance covered. The charges will be dollar-based to cushion the Chinese operator from exchange rate losses. hkimuyu@ke.nationmedia.com
