An alcoholic drink in a glass. FILE PHOTO | NMG I’m at Vibro Club in Nairobi West, I just arrived, it’s closing on midnight and I’m at the bar counter wedged between many humans, and I’m about to fetch my whisky. Guess who I see, sitting there in his colourful Madiba shirt? Leonard Mambo Mbotela! The radio legend. The original voice of radio. The voice of thunder and god. Of course, I go over and pay homage. I tell him he is a natural treasure. I buy him his drinks then I settle on a chair where I can watch him. Bilenge Musica or some band is killing it on stage. Really killing it. The vibe is celebratory and nostalgic. Franco and Madilu and the rumba legend swirl in the room. The men are not young, maybe in their 50s on average. I spot a burly man in Azimio shirt. The women are younger or just about. Everybody is there because they love rumba. I see a gynaecologist I used to know once upon a time. He is in his 60s. He is dancing to Sam Mangwana’s song, 'Ibrahim.' It’s a sensual song, as only Sam can be. The band is versatile, talented and most importantly they can read the energy of the room. The dancing stage rises and falls with dancers of years yonder. Men and women sway to the music on the dance-floor or by their tables. “Isn’t that your pal Fred Afune?!” My lady shouts in my ear over the loud music. There is a man dancing elegantly, like a flowing river, his back to us. He looks like Fred Afune but the Afune I know - although an aficionado of rumba - would not have a sweet rhythm like that. “I doubt Fred can dance like that,” I tell her before texting Fred to tell him I have seen a fella like him at Vibro. He says he is out of town. In the village. I’m relieved. The night at Vibro went on and on. The service was swift [thanks Akinyi] and attentive. The centrepiece of the night, naturally, was that band. I would be back to watch them again and again and again. Go, but only if you can stand Rumba music.
