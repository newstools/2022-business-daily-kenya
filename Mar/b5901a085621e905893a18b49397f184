The National Assembly and the Senate have resolved a deadlock over a Bill that seeks to provide a framework for disbursement of conditional grants from donors. The Treasury had last week warned that donors may withdraw Sh39 billion in conditional grants to counties following a stalemate between the Senate and the National Assembly. The Treasury told Parliament that development partners have raised concerns over the non-movement of conditional grants to the 47 devolved units. Out of the Sh39 billion that is stuck at the Treasury, Sh7 billion is conditional grants from the National Government share while Sh32 billion is donor funds meant for specific projects. The resolution of the stalemate over the County Governments Conditional Grants Bill, 2021 will see the Treasury release the funds barely two months to the close of the current financial year. “We have agreed that the Senate version of the Bill should proceed for adoption by both Houses. We will expedite the passage to ensure that money is expeditiously sent to counties,” Charles Kabiru, the chairperson of the Senate committee on Finance and Budget said. The Mediation committee comprising members from both Houses of Parliament reached the agreement at a meeting on Thursday. emutai@ke.nationmedia.com
