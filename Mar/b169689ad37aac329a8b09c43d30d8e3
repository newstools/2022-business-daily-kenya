Thugs forced their way into Ushirika Bank at 1.30 pm, just as the money was in transit from Co-operative Bank Bungoma under the escort of the injured officers. Kimilili sub-county police commander Muita Marwa said detectives had launched a manhunt for the thieves. “Our preliminary probe has established that the money, Sh25 million meant to pay [coffee] farmers, was being escorted from Cooperative Bank in Bungoma town to Ushirika Bank in Kimilili town...we suspect [thugs] had waylaid the security officers, made a daring attack and fled with the cash just a few minutes after the money arrived at Ushirika Bank this afternoon,” said Mr Marwa. He asked residents to volunteer information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects. “This is a very daring attack by the criminals that our officers are probing and we want to assure members of the public that we shall arrest them,” he said. The bank manager and police officers were rushed to Kimilili sub-county hospital for first aid before being transferred to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret town where they are said to be in stable condition. The bank manager, Kennedy Khalakai was shot on the left side of the stomach and the bullet is still lodged in, while police officers Boniface Hamisi and Joseph Lomulen were shot on the thigh and knee, respectively. A heavy exchange of gunfire ensued as the robbers, whose number remains unknown, escaped towards Chwele market. They are suspected to have later fled into Uganda in a getaway car. Kimilili residents have raised concern over rising insecurity in the area and have asked police to intensify patrols.
