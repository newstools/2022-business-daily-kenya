I used to think the Ngong Hills hotel was in Ngong Hills. It’s on Ngong Roa. Maybe from the highest room, you can see the Ngong Hills and those lovely turbines. I also used to imagine that it’s one of the old relic hotels where old men sit around drinking warm Pilsner and reminiscing about the 60s Boogie-woogie dance. Indeed, it’s a bit old [1975]. I also used to hear people talk about some bar in there that was all the rave and that played old-school music. So I went to have a look. Getting into Art and Soul felt like getting into a disco. There was a 90s vibe to it. The kitschy decor. The moody lighting. A popular soul-music deejay played music from a deck. The crowd was distinctively in their 40s and 50s - men and women who know what breakdance is. Who perhaps wore Savco jeans at some point in their lives —or thought about it. The music was amazing. Nostalgia filled the room until they started playing a James Ingram song and it just brought memories of unrequited love. It reminded me of a girl I loved who rejected me for so long and so consistently that I wondered if her heart was made from wood. I wasn’t sad hearing that song, just surprised that a song would bring such fresh memories many years later. I ran into a gentleman I had interviewed way back in 2012. He was wearing a loud shirt. After niceties I said, ‘is there a song that reminds you of an unrequited love?’ and he said, “Mr. Telephone man by Bobby Brown.” We touched glasses to unrequited love. Art And Soul was a vault into the past. It’s where men and women went to connect to their old selves when they loved hard and bruised easily. It’s where you go to revisit the foolishness, and headiness of youth. There seemed to be general unspoken energy in the room; that we have survived this long and we are here and we are grateful for life and time. And that if we go up to the top floor we might see Ngong Hills because what’s the point of the Ngong Hills hotel if you can’t see Ngong Hills?
