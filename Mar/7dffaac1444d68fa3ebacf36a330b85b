PHOTO | JOSEPH KANYI | NMG One in every six parents in Kenya paid a bribe, gift or did a favour for a teacher to get services in the admission of their children to public schools last year, a survey has shown. The Afrobarometer survey also showed that 73 percent of Kenyans who had contacted a school to obtain services found it very difficult. The proportion more than doubled from 32 percent in 2019 with respondents saying they found it difficult to get assistance in learning institutions. The difficulties in accessing services were attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic which led to the closure of many private schools. The survey conducted in November last year sampled 2,400 respondents. In contrast, most respondents who had contact with a public school said that in general, teachers and school officials treat them with a lot of respect (52 per cent) or some respect at 28 percent. About 60 percent of parents said they were likely to hold teachers accountable in the event of misbehavior such as absenteeism and mistreatment of students. This was regardless of the parent’s level of education with (post-secondary (65), secondary (60), primary (58) and no formal education at 58 per cent. Two in three Kenyans (65 percent) said the government is addressing educational needs fairly well, which was a drop from 75 percent in 2019. Recently, Kenya changed its education curriculum to a competency-based curriculum where learners spend two years of preprimary education followed by six years of secondary and at least three years of tertiary education. With the introduction of CBC system, more than half of the respondents (52 percent) believed that it will improve education in the country. Only one in four (26 percent) said the CBC system will not improve education. emwenda@ke.nationmedia.com
