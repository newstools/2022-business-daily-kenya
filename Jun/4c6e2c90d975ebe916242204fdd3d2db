The Bill allocates each of the 47 devolved units Sh110.64 million for the leasing of the controversial multi-billion medical deal for the provision of specialised medical kits. The national government contracted five firms to lease specialised kits such as theatre equipment, renal kits, ICU equipment and radiology equipment to the counties for treating diseases like cancer and diabetes. President Uhuru Kenyatta, in 2015, unveiled the medical leasing deal that has remained controversial as many counties have not utilised medical kits worth millions of shillings due to a lack of specialised staff to operate them, lack of power and rooms to set them up. Kenya signed the deal with Shenzhen Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics Limited, Esteem Industries, Bellco SRL, Phillips East Africa Limited and General Electric East Africa Limited which have been providing the kits. The Treasury allocated Sh4.5 billion every year or Sh95.7 million per county in 2015/16, 2016/17 and 2017/18 financial years. The amount was increased to Sh9.4 billion or Sh200 million per county in the 2018/19 period but reduced to Sh6.2 billion or Sh131.9 million per county in the year ended June 2020. The Bill makes provision for the transfer of conditional allocations from the national government's share of revenue and from development partners to the county governments. emutai@ke.nationmedia.com
