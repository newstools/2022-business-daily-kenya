FILE PHOTO | NMG The hearing of a case for the control of garment maker Manchester Outfitters Ltd has taken a new twist after the High Court confiscated five books from the main witness after opposing parties pointed out that he was reading questions and answers prepared for him. A bench of three judges took five spiral-bound booklets from Mr Pravin Galot who is testifying in the matter pitting him and his uncle Mohan Galot over the shareholding of the company. Mr Pravin and his uncle Mohan, a renowned billionaire businessman, are embroiled in a dispute over who is the legitimate managing director of the garment manufacturing company that was started over 60 years ago. Justices Lilian Mutende, Grace Ngenye and John Mativo barred Pravin from using pre-prepared questions and answers while giving his testimony. “Undeniably, a case belongs to a client and ideally there is nothing wrong with a litigant exhibiting a deep knowledge of his case including the ability to recall facts and all the documents with military precision,” the judges said.

Advocates representing the opposing parties claimed that the answers were not coming from the witness but a pre-typed sheet, suggesting that he was coached.
