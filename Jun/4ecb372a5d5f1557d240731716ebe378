President Uhuru Kenyatta promised a 33 percent cut in the cost of electricity last year in a move to boost investor climate in the scramble for investors coming to Africa. The second cut was premised on negotiations with independent power producers, which have not materialised. The State has also not provided a budget for the second cut after offering Kenya Power a Sh14 billion subsidy leading to the first 15 percent cut. President Kenyatta is exiting the scene having failed to lower electricity prices which have limited Kenya’s manufacturing capacity and hurt consumers. Electricity prices have risen 57 percent since Mr Kenyatta rose to power in 2013, with 50 units rising from Sh508 in July 2013 to Sh797 in May 2022. Power prices should be a priority for the incoming administration, to deal with the high cost of living on households that have for years grappled with steep power bills. The cost of power also influences investment.
