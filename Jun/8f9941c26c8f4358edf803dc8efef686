FILE PHOTO | NMG Pump prices have increased to a new historic high, with a litre of super petrol and diesel jumping by Sh9, signalling a further increase in the cost of basic goods and services. The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) has increased the price of petrol to Sh159.12 per litre and Sh140 for diesel in Nairobi— the highest Kenya's history.  The prices, which will be in force until July 14, will pile more pressure on households and motorists, given that diesel is a key determinant of the basket of goods and services used to measure inflation. Producers of services such as electricity and manufactured goods usually factor in the higher cost of petroleum. The record prices come amid increased crude prices in the global market, rising to $112.48 from $93.99 in the last pricing cycle.
