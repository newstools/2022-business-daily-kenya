Passengers alight at Kisumu Railways Station. FILE PHOTO | NMG Passenger behaviour has a significant influence on transport operations. No wonder the Kenya Railways Corporation has switched back to ferrying travellers on the Nairobi-Kisumu route at night. Before the collapse of the rail link to western Kenya a decade ago due to its dilapidated state, the Kisumu train operated at night. However, with the resumption of passenger trains on the route in December 2021, they opted for daytime travel. Six months later, the firm has reverted to the previous schedule. This begs the question, does the corporation take time to study the passenger behaviour and customise services to reap the benefits of traffic flow? What perchance influenced the decision for daytime trains on a route that even the entrenched road transporters have mostly night operations? It is good that the company has now acknowledged that its target market prefers night travel and reorganised its operations accordingly. Also commendable is the increase of stops along the route. This will help woo more travellers to utilise the service, making it viable in the long run for the operator. Understanding the user patterns is crucial for rail transport as it can serve as the backbone for economic development.
