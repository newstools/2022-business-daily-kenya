FILE PHOTO | NMG A Chinese firm that completed the construction of the Loiyangalani-Suswa power transmission line has offered to waive a Sh1.1 billion interest claim against the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (Ketraco) in a bid to unlock payment of Sh1.138 billion due from the State. Nari and PowerChina Guizhou Engineering (Nari-PCGE), which completed the line that is being used to evacuate electricity from Lake Turkana Wind Power (LTWP) project, told Parliament that it is willing to waive the interest that has accrued over four years if this will prompt the Treasury to make good the principal dues.

The firm was tapped in 2018 to complete the 428-kilometre 400kV line after Spanish contractor Isolux, which had been contracted for the job, went bankrupt. “The consortium of Nari and Powerchina Guizhou Engineering was willing to negotiate and discount on the interest component if the government of Kenya is to pay the principal amount, which has been due for four years,” the Public Investments Committee says in its inquiry into of the LTWP project. The offer comes just months after the Treasury received Sh785 million the Standard Chartered Bank in Frankfurt, Germany had rejected as a refund for excess pay from Kenya Power to LTWP.
