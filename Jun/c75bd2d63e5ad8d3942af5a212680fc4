FILE PHOTO | NMG Parliament wants CEOs of State corporations without title deeds to their properties to put caveats on all the parcels of land that are in private hands. The National Assembly’s Public Investments Committee (PIC), in a report to the House, says most corporations have no title documents to vast parcels of land. The committee singled out the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), which has 222 pieces of land spread across the country but only holds title documents for 45 parcels. The committee also flagged the Kenya Ports Authority, Kenya Airports Authority, Kenya National Highways Authority, Kenya Railways Corporation, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, and the Bomas of Kenya. “The accounting officers of State corporations and the chairperson of the National Land Commission (NLC) should put caveats on all the parcels of State corporations’ land that are in private hands,” PIC chairman Abdulswamad Nassir said in a report to Parliament. PIC said KWS had not included land as part of the property, plant and equipment item. Of the 24 national parks registered 12 have title deeds while only one of the 29 national reserves has the ownership document. “NLC should prioritise and expedite resolution of ownership issues surrounding parcels of land belonging to State corporations,” PIC said. emutai@ke.nationmedia.com
