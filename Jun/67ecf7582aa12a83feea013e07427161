Power supply for electric car charging. PHOTO | POOL Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) has installed an electric vehicle charging station in Nairobi as the State agency joins other actors steering the push for e-mobility. Catherine Nyambala, an engineer at KenGen, said the power producer will in the coming days ship in electric cars to test the station and help with data that is key to boosting policy legislation for e-mobility. The revelation comes barely a month after Kenya rolled out the first electric bus as the shift to e-mobility gathers pace.
