The brands include 750ml KO Classic and Tambuzi, retailing at Sh2,400 and Sh1,350 respectively. “We believe our gin brands are a good addition to the Kenyan local alcobev scene, “What is unique to KO & 5.8 versus other gin brands, we are the first company to craft using local ingredients/ botanicals and distill locally for the Kenyan audience,” Kenyan Originals founder Alexandra Chappatte says. The beverages incorporate locally-sourced flavours such as bitter orange leaves, lemongrass, bay leaves, roses, hibiscus, baobab, njugu (peanuts), mint, Ginger, mangoes and Chilli. According to Chappatte, the unveiling of the product shows that Kenya can produce world class locally-distilled Gins with rich flavors and expertise. “We want consumers to go on a local botanical sourcing journey with us through our liquids. Knowing how rich Kenya is from a botanicals perspective they should expect future extensions of both gin brands,” Fresh young talented distiller Ian says. Currently, the firm non-alcoholic product line includes Tropical and Hibiscus flavour. Under its alcoholic line, it sells products such as passion fruit and lime, lime and ginger, mango and ginger, among other flavours. Products are sold in major retail chains such as Naivas, Quickmart and Chandarana. “The gin is KEBS approved and our business is 100 percent KRA compliant. Both bodies have very strict requirements for businesses handling raw spirits to ensure full compliance is in order.” kvnrotich@gmai.com
