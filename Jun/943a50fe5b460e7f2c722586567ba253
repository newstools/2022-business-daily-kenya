Livestock PS Harry Kimtai said the government had set aside Sh500 million for the construction of a livestock facility at the Lamu port. The PS said Kenya has signed various sanitary protocols with the Middle East countries to facilitate the export of livestock products. “We want to establish facilities at the Lamu port that will support the docking of ocean vessels to allow the loading of livestock using the right procedures that take into consideration the issue of animal welfare,” said Mr Kimtai. Kenya has mainly been exporting high-value products such as butter, ghee, powder and long life milk product such as UHT to the Arab nations as it sought to diversify its market beyond the East African region. The Lamu port is ideal for livestock exports because of its proximity to the key animal production areas in northeastern Kenya. The facility is also ideal for the exportation of livestock due to its deep harbour and wide channels that allow for easy navigation of shipping vessels. Mr Kimtai also said the government would establish a holding ground next to the port that will be used as a quarantine facility to certify animals for export. gandae@ke.nationmedia.com
