The State should issue title deeds to all parcels of land held by parastatals that are at risk of being grabbed by private developers. The push by the National Assembly’s Public Investments Committee (PIC) to put caveats on all the parcels of land owned by State corporations and currently held by private companies and individuals cannot help much. The committee singled out the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), which has 222 pieces of land spread across the country but only holds title documents for 45 parcels. Of the 24 national parks registered 12 have title deeds while only one of the 29 national reserves has the ownership document. The committee also flagged the Kenya Ports Authority, Kenya Airports Authority, Kenya National Highways Authority, Kenya Railways Corporation, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, and the Bomas of Kenya. Lands ministry and affected agencies must work to process title deeds instead of putting temporary measures that grabbers can devise means to circumvent. The government is responsible for issuing title deeds, therefore it is not rocket science to ensure that public land and property owned by State agencies have documents clearly stating ownership.
