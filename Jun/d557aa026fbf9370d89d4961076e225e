Uhuru has 884 units while Outering has 360. The project is being funded through the Ward Development Fund (WDF), which received an allocation of Sh1.5 billion in the current financial year. It is managed by NMS after it was transferred by ward reps last year from the Office of the Governor.

This is a continuation of the inventory exercise that started in May last year in collaboration with the Kenya Revenue Authority and the county government.
