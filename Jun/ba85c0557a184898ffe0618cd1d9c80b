Kenyan courts should pick lessons from other jurisdictions and expedite cases to deliver justice to victims. The slow wheels of justice in the country are partly to blame for corruption and increasing criminal activities such as money laundering. Criminals have been cushioned from the consequences of their deeds because cases drag in the corridors of justice and some end up without being solved. In other instances, victims die even without seeing perpetrators face the full force of the law. As a country, we should be ashamed that criminals extradited to other jurisdictions such as the United States are convicted in record time. Abubakar Mansur Mohammed Surur, a Kenyan who was extradited to the US for trafficking rhinoceros horns and ivory, has pleaded guilty to a charge in a New York court and is awaiting sentencing soon. This is a case that would have dragged in Kenyan courts for years. UK officials who were involved in the infamous Chickegate scandal, in which former electoral commission officials were implicated, have already served their terms in jail while their Kenyan accomplices walk free. In a separate case, the Akasha brothers are serving their terms in US prisons after they were sentenced in months. In Kenya, authorities failed to prosecute cases allowing them to continue with their illicit trade.
