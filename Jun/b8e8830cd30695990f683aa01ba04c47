Mr Stephen Musina. FILE PHOTO | NMG A former procurement officer at Pumwani Maternity Hospital has been handed the option of paying a fine of Sh1 million after he was found guilty and jailed for two-and-a-half years in prison for corruption. Mr Stephen Musina, who was jailed by a Nairobi court in 2016 without the option of a fine, will now pay the fine after the High Court ruled that the trial magistrate made a mistake for jailing him without giving him the alternative of paying the fine. “I therefore set aside the judgment and substitute with an order directing the appellant to pay a fine of Sh1 million. He will serve the sentence in default,” High Court judge Esther Maina ruled. Mr Musina was convicted and jailed for two counts of corruption over the procurement for the supply of surgical materials at a cost of Sh1.22 million on offence he committed on November 12, 2010. The former procurement officer was accused of failing to disclose in a tender, which was awarded to a company in which he was a director. The trial magistrate sentenced him to jail without the option of a fine and he appealed arguing that the decision was harsh. Mr Musina argued that although the trial court had discretion to pass such a sentence, where the law specifically provides that the sentence of a fine is an option, it should be handed as an alternative to custodial sentence. His appeal against the conviction was, however, dismissed by Justice Maina. The former government official had submitted that the trial court had, without any justifiable reason, shifted the burden of proof to him, prejudiced him. He pleaded with the High Court saying he was a single parent and the conviction and the sentence should be quashed. Mr Musina has been out on cash bail of Sh500,000.
