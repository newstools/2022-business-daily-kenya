FILE PHOTO | NMG Traders at City Park market in Nairobi have appealed to the county government to waive the Sh150 parking fee levied at the facility to attract more buyers. City Park Market chairperson Daniel Kamau said the fee levied at the facility that was upgraded at a cost of Sh142 million has kept off buyers, a move that has seen their sales drop. Customers have been paying between Sh100 and Sh150 depending on the number of hours they spend when they come shopping at City park market. The spacious market in Parklands was scheduled for an upgrade as the rehabilitation of green spaces gained momentum early last year. “We want parking charges at City Park market waived for the next three months so that more customers can come and buy our products,” said Mr Kamau. Housing Principal Secretary Charles Hinga however told the Business Daily that charging parking fees at the facility is important as it is a source of revenue. He however said he would hold talks with the County government of Nairobi and the Nairobi Metropolitan Service on giving a grace period to customers coming to shop at the facility. “We want to advertise and market this place first so that when I come tomorrow and you tell me to pay for example Sh5, it will be worth it,” he said. Parking at the facility was opened on Monday. It can accommodate up to 200 vehicles at ago. This includes 23 parking lots for disabled people. botieno@ke.nationmedia.com
