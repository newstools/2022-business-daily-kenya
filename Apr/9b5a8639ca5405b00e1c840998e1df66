Justice James Rika said the dismissal of the detective, Charles Mwazo Mwaizinga, a Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), was valid and that the employer followed the standards of fairness in removing him from service. "At the heart of his removal was a very grave accusation of allowing to be used, or failing to prevent from being used, a Police vehicle as a means of transportation of an illegal drug and other contrabands. Police officers are supposed to prevent drug trafficking, not proliferate drug trafficking, using Police vehicles," said the Labour Relations judge. He declined the officer's claim of general damages quoted at Sh15 million for the violation of his rights as well as for pain and suffering caused by the Commission’s actions. Mr Mwaizinga was the County Criminal Investigating Officer for Wajir before he was sacked on October 7, 2019. His junior, PC Japhet Fondo, drove from Wajir to Nairobi and was intercepted by a multi-agency team at Kanyonyo market, along Garisa-Thika road, on October 2, 2019, ferrying illegal goods, which included 254 Kilogrammes of bhang. jwangui@ke.nationmedia.com
