Workers offloading fertliser from a truck. FILE PHOTO | NMG Farmers have been protesting the high cost of fertiliser for months now. Finally, the government has heeded their calls and the prices have dropped to Sh2,800 for a 50-kilogramme bag from Sh6,400. This is a good move because Kenya’s agriculture depends on heavy subsidies for fertiliser and other inputs. Hopefully, the lower prices will encourage more farmers to increase production levels, translating into a reduction in the cost of food in the coming months. The Ministry of Agriculture has limited the distribution to 20 bags per grower. To ensure that every farmer gets the fertiliser which will support the cultivation of 1.13 million acres and the product is not hoarded or resold at higher prices, the sale and distribution should be transparent. Kenya is hovering on the brink of famine and without ensuring the fertiliser reaches the right people at the subsidised prices, many will be unable to plant this season. Corruption in the fertiliser subsidy programme will only see Kenya keep extending the begging bowl to the world.
