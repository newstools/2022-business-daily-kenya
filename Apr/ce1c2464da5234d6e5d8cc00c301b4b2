The closure has affected a number of flights especially those used by tourists visiting various parts of the country. Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) director-general Gilbert Kibe confirmed the closure saying it started at 10 am and will end at 5 pm. “There are military operations currently going on around Wilson Airport airspace which is why the airport has been temporarily closed,” said Mr Kibe in a response to a Business Daily query Wednesday.
