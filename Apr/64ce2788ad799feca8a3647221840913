The additional funds contained in the Supplementary Budget 1 will go towards the construction of 10,000 classrooms to support the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC). The first phase of the CBC classrooms comprising 5,200 classrooms has been completed, paving the way for the start of the second phase this month. The government is targeting to expand CBC infrastructure by building 10,000 classrooms at a cost of Sh8 billion in readiness for the roll-out of junior secondary when Grade Six pupils graduate at the end of the year. “The target is to have in place 2,500 classrooms and the construction process is currently ongoing,” Florence Mutua, who chairs the Education Committee of the National Assembly said in a report on the scrutiny of the Supplementary Budget 1 for 2021/22. President Uhuru Kenyatta last year directed that the new classrooms be built by local contractors to provide space for the 1 million Grade Six learners who will be joining secondary school next January. He said the venture will facilitate 100 percent transition for the pioneer CBC class. More than 8.1 million children are enrolled under the new education system. The rollout of the CBC started in 2018, introducing disruptive changes where elementary education is divided into pre-primary and primary education, taking two and six years respectively. Junior secondary starts from Grade Seven up to Grade Nine. emutai@ke.nationmedia.com
