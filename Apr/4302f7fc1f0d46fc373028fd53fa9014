The government must make good on its promise to take action on oil marketers who contributed to the shortage of petroleum products seen in recent days. The lack of fuel in many parts of the country comes amid evidence that there are enough stocks of the critical commodity, raising the question about what caused the market failure. There have been allegations that some dealers have withheld petroleum supplies to protest delayed payment of fuel subsidy cash. This caused a major shortage of the products, creating a black market where prices shot to Sh240 per litre for both diesel and petrol, substantially above the levels set by the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra). Clearly, there is a need for accountability and it is a good thing that the government is conducting investigations into this matter. We expect severe action to be taken against those found guilty. The Petroleum Act of 2019 imposes a fine of Sh10 million or five years in jail for dealers who sell fuel above the price set by Epra. Those caught hoarding fuel risk fines of not less than Sh1 million or one year in jail or both. We also urge the government to pay the fuel subsidy promptly to ease the cash flow of oil marketers.
