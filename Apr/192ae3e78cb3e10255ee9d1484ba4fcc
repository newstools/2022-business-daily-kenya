The push to introduce regulations that ensure SIM cards used by children is long overdue. Kenya is shifting to online learning and more parents, guardians are acquiring gadgets for their children to use at home and in school. This has exposed children to many online threats and vices, including pornography, suicide plans, recruitment to terrorism groups, sale and buying of weapons. Parents and telecoms firms will soon be fined Sh300,000 for failure to register children using smartphones in the latest push to restrict the exposure of minors to the growing online misconduct. As much as this is a good move there should be public awareness of why this is important, especially at a time when there is an increase in cyber-attacks. Parents and guardians should be educated on the importance of warning children against visiting suspicious websites. For their part, app developers need to provide controls in web browsers and app stores that allow parents to monitor and control the browsing behaviour of their children. But guidelines are just like good manners and people can choose to follow them or not. Let the government tighten the rules on the use of smartphones and Internet to protect children online. There should be a law that regulates telecommunications companies, Internet service providers, app developers, and content creators. The Communications Authority of Kenya says the Child Online Protection and Safety Guidelines will demand that these organisations verify the age of their users. This should be part of a law to ensure that it is adhered to because guidelines are not enforceable by law and are usually introduced for sound practice. Coming up with laws that pay attention to sites that contain harmful content in children ensures that they are protected. Nonetheless, we need to be aware that technology helps children in learning, and for them to be at par with their peers in the more advanced countries, we should be careful not to stifle growth made so far.
