Some institutions have reportedly received hundreds of students despite lacking the required facilities. FILE PHOTO | NMG Implementing the goverment policy of 100 percent transition to secondary school without the requisite infrastructure is a recipe for disaster. While Kenya’s aspirations to achieve universal basic education through the 2018 policy, the hapharzard implementation will result in congestion, teacher shortage and strain on the available learning equipment. The country has 32,473 primary schools, according to Economic Survey data. If all the pupils from these schools were to transition, they would overwhelm the 10,413 secondary schools. This would mean teacher shortage, sharing of desks and other equipment, resulting in negative learning outcomes. The numbers show there has been clearly insufficient investment in secondary school education, which requires rapid expansion before the government policy can be implemented. Where the government has not been able to satisfy the entire demand for advanced education, the private sector has often come into play. It is worth noting that the number of private secondary schools have been dropping from 1,756 in 2018 to 1,301 in 2020. This means that the policy for 100 percent transition should be accompanied by a strategy to attract the participation of the private sector.
