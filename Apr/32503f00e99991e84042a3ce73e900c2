While marking 10 years of its operations, Kentrade said the implementation of the National Electronic Single Window System Bill, 2021, would give it more powers as it is currently operating under an Executive order. Kentrade chairman Mugambi Imanyara expressed optimism the Bill would be passed in the next one month before Parliament is adjourned. "The Bill is slated for second reading early April and once it is passed into law, it will help to curb fraud and exploitation in the logistics coordination system often faced by importers and exporters using the platform," said Mr Imanyara. The Bill seeks to, among other issues, simplify and synchronise processing of data, enable the standardisation of documents and single decision-making for customs release and clearance as well as facilitate electronic transactions in trade to reduce legal and operational barriers to electronic transactions. Kentrade chief executive officer Amos Wangora said the upgraded system will integrate all systems including the Kenya Revenue Authority’s Integrated Customs Management System. “The new platform shall serve as a single entry point and platform for any person involved in trade and transport. The users will be able to lodge documents electronically including import or export documents for processing and approval and facilitate the electronic payment for fees and levies, due to the government, on goods imported or exported for transactions submitted through the System,” said Mr Wangora. akitimo@ke.nationmedia.com
