Mr Philemon Kandie, the acting Director-General of the Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA). PHOTO | POOL A law student wants the court to stop the Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA) from recruiting a director-general, arguing that the advertisement calling for applicants violated provisions of the Kenya Roads Act. The roads agency is currently led by Philemon Kandie who was appointed in an acting capacity in July 2020. The petitioner, Emmanuel Gisesa, says the advertisement last month violated Section 14 of the law by purporting to reduce post-registration experience for eligible candidates to 10 years, yet the Act requires 15 years. Justice Jacob Gakeri of the Employment and Labour Relations Court certified the case urgent and directed him to serve the Attorney-General and Parliament with the court papers ahead of the hearing on April 22. Mr Gisesa says the agency failed to advertise the position on its website and radio as required by Section 37 (1) of the Public Service Commission Act. The petitioner said the KeRRA also did not give potential applicants at least 21 days to present their applications as required by Public Service Commission Human Resource and Policies Procedure Manual. skiplagat@ke.nationmedia.com
