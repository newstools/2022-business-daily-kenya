Labour Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui says the department of Human Resource Planning and Development under the ministry lacks a uniform structure that can be used by human resource practitioners and employers. This is attributed to new occupations arising regularly within this sector with innovations and different names assigned to the same ICT courses in universities and colleges. “Currently the ministry is updating occupations within the ICT sector and the main challenge we face is the fast pace at which tasks performed by various occupations within ICT change, hence creating new emerging occupations,” said Mr Chelugui. Some of the skills available in the sector include app developers, graphic designers, cybersecurity, project managers, content writers, and digital marketing. However, with increased innovations and investment in the sector, other skills are coming up such as artificial intelligence, data engineering for manipulation of data, user interface and machine learning. ekivuva@ke.nationmedia.com
