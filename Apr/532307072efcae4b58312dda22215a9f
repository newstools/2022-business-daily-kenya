KQ, as the carrier is known, says the discount to aspiring drone pilots will only apply to those that paid before April 14 to enjoy the three weeks training. The airline had initially said that it will charge Sh180,000 for a month-long course for one to obtain a Remote Pilot License. This means that a three-week training will go at Sh114,750 if the discount is factored in. The charges also exclude the cost of obtaining a Class 3 aviation medical exam which costs about Sh10,000. “This three weeks course prepares you to obtain the Remote Pilot Licence issued by Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA),” said KQ. The carrier has for a long time been relying on travellers as the main source of revenue but it is now looking at new areas of investment with an eye on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This is after the KCAA legalised the use of drones in the country, triggering what is shaping up to be a commercial drone delivery race. botieno@ke.nationmedia.com
