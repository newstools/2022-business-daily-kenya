The penalties follow the expiry of the six months grace period for firms to set up in-house platforms that will assess risks and exposure to corruption, train staff on fighting graft and establish internal networks for workers to anonymously report suspected bribery and graft cases. The firms will also be expected to hire anti-corruption executives, have a written code to map out corruption risks and report cases to the anti-graft agency within 24 hours. Companies had six months from October 14 to comply with the stringent requirements as the State shifts focus to the private sector in the war against corruption. The regulations are anchored on the Bribery Act, 2016 which places the offence on directors and senior officials whenever their companies fail to establish internal controls and systems to fight and report corruption. High-ranking officials in the private sector have now joined State and public officers in the list of persons required to fight and report corruption, a crime that has seen taxpayers lose billions of shillings every year. “Any entity to which these Regulations apply shall establish the procedures required under section nine within six months from the date of the publication of the Guidelines under section 12 (2) of the Act,” Attorney-General Paul Kihara says in the regulations. The requirements also compel companies to protect whistleblowers within their businesses or set up channels that allow leaking of corrupt dealings. The guidelines follow an anti-bribery law of 2016 that was drafted by the private sector. jmutua@ke.nationmedia.com
