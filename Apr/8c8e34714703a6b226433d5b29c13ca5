The Port of Mombasa is recording increased transshipment business as more ships evade berthing “delays and waiting” at the Dar port. Over the past month, Mombasa has handled more than 10 feeder ships transshipping Port of Dar es Salaam containers advancing her opportunities for a regional transshipment hub. MSc Shipping Line, the second global liner, has confirmed using the port of Mombasa until the situation normalises in Dar es Salaam. Others include CMA CGM and Maersk Shipping Lines. Statistics show that at the beginning of this month 7,894 Twenty Feet Equivalent Units transshipment to Dar landed in Mombasa to await nomination for second carriers to the ports of Dar and Zanzibar. KPA general manager (operations) Sudi Mwasinago says among the lines discharging in Mombasa for Dar es Salaam, MSC accounts for 75 percent of the volumes while CMA CGM and Maersk take 24 percent and nine percent respectively. "There has been a significant rise in transshipment business," said Mr Mwasinago. akitimo@ke.nationmedia.com
