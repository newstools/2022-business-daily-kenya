In just one year of President Samia Suluhu where relations between Kenya and Tanzania thawed, trade between the two East African countries crossed the Sh100 billion mark for the first time. The value of goods traded hit Sh107.63 billion in 12 months through March 2022, a 66.86 percent growth. Kenyan traders spent Sh56.78 billion to truck in goods from Tanzania in the year ended March 2022, a 77.92 percent jump of over Sh31.91 billion a year earlier. Exports to Tanzania, on the other hand, bumped 56.03 percent to Sh50.85 billion. Kenya’s trade with Tanzania had suffered through the past decade as Nairobi and Dar squabbled over accusations of isolationism under the Coalition of the Willing, Covid-19 curbs, regional trade pact with the EU, tariff and non-tariff barriers. President Suluhu pledged to end persistent strained trade relations. Kenya should capitalise on this goodwill to ensure relations remain smooth for expansion of trade.
