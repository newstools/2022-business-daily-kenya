The accident also involved a lorry that also overturned. Kenya has been rocked by several deadly explosions caused by fuel accidents in recent years. In 2021, 13 people were killed when a petrol tanker overturned and caught fire in western Kenya after colliding with another vehicle on the Kisumu and Busia highway. People had rushed to the scene with jerrycans to siphon off fuel from the overturned tanker before it exploded. A night accident in 2016 killed 33 people near Karai on the Nairobi-Naivasha highway after a truck carrying inflammable substances rammed several vehicles before bursting into flames. In March, a boda boda rider was burnt to death and a truck which was transporting building blocks caught fire and was destroyed. Two fuel tankers crashed into each other along the Webuye-Eldoret highway, veering off the road and ploughed into power lines at a market before they crashed into a ditch. Traders escaped death narrowly after the fuel tankers exploded, turning the market into a ball of fire.
