PHOTO | JEFF ANGOTE | NMG The Kenya Airports Authority has a case to answer on the delayed completion of works to revamp departure terminals at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA). One, the increased traffic is good for the economy and the big numbers contributed to the decision to expand the facility. It is, therefore, depressing that the expansion is now making the situation worse with the airlines citing losses due to the snail's pace of processing passengers. The Sh936 million renovation targets better and faster screening. Two, while works may have varied completion timelines due to unavoidable hitches, it is unacceptable that the KAA has missed the deadline by close to one year. The agency must speed up the work. JKIA is a key hub that connects the world and it would be wrong to miss this clear vision and how the effectiveness or slowness impacts the economy. Three, when passengers miss connections, they will simply think twice about JKIA and drop the facility at a time Kenya's neighbours are busy revamping their facilities, stepping up competition for JKIA. We ask the KAA to stick to international codes guiding such projects.
