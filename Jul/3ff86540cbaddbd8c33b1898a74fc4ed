It is the political season again where the landscape is about to be redefined by the approaching general election. This election season has seen unique approaches by politicians in communicating their agenda and suitability for the offices they are clamouring for. The 2017 polls saw the surprise election of Paul Mwirigi as MP for Igembe South who had conducted his campaign door to door on foot. A number of candidates in the current political season have successfully replicated that formula. Most of the candidates are banking on being more popular across all possible spectrums than their opponents. Be it in the news, social media, posters and rallies. Here, popularity is the currency. The use of these key publicity assets ranges from highly slick operations that speak of clear strategy to incoherent and patchwork operations that barely register on the larger public awareness. Question is: how does a green candidate create awareness of their candidacy and generate good publicity that a meaningful section of the public can take note? The fight for this attention means generating news all the time and in ways that stand out. The two leading presidential contenders generated a buzz. The use of sheng, music and popular bloggers by the political class has been taken to another level. The season of politics brings about all manner of drama as candidates seek to outdo their opponents in being a man or woman of the people. The issues that crop up on different opponents also rises several times fold. As an aspirant, having a good grasp of these two areas and coming up with ways of muddling through will keep you in a good position for the public to engage with you.
