A corner of the garden at Chez Sonia. PHOTO | COURTESY Bordeaux, what kind of wine is that?” I asked the beautiful waitress at Chez Sonia along Nairobi's Peponi Road. I am the kind of boring drinker who when he discovers something, I do not want to discover something else. It is limiting, of course, because it stands in the way of adventure and discovery.

It is romantic at night if you want to look into someone’s eyes but just carry your credit card. Alternatively, if you can jump over a fence…
