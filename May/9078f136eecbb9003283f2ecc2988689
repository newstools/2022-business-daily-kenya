The station is located at Naivasha Safari Centre, Dowgate’s new shopping mall whose anchor tenant is Naivas Supermarket, along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. The firm joins others like ChargeNet and Drive Electric, which have set up centres in Nairobi to provide the equivalent of petrol stations for electric cars. Electricity distributor Kenya Power says it is ready to work with electric mobility firms by supplying electricity for charging the batteries. “Car ownership and travelling have changed completely in the last decade and are set to change even more as Kenyans.... also begin to shift towards electric vehicles (EVs),” said James Hoddell, Dowgate Properties founder and director. Momentum has been growing for adopting electric vehicles in Kenya as calls for clean energy solutions to reverse climate change impact get louder.

BasiGo is pioneering a new generation of eco-friendly buses that are set to reduce carbon emissions in major cities like Nairobi, Nakuru, Kisumu and Mombasa. Opibus converts diesel and petrol vehicles and motorcycle engines into electric, while Kiri manufactures electric motorbikes. The Safari Centre, which also has eateries and children’s play areas, is the first mall by Dowgates. The firm plans to open a similar centre at Makutano, along the Nairobi-Nyeri road. emwenda@ke.nationmedia.com
