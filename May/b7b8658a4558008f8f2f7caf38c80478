Employees in the NGO world took home an average of Sh313,000 a month last year, data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) released on Thursday shows. The foreign-backed NGOs have for years recorded the high compensation arising from the fact that they are well funded and rely heavily on highly skilled professionals. Kenya’s economy rebounded to grow 7.5 percent in 2021 compared to a contraction of 0.3 percent a year earlier, with the economic expansion largely boosted by the easing of Covid-19 restrictions which helped recovery in key sectors with exception of agriculture.

According to the KNBS data, employees of energy sector firms are the third-highest paid in the country. The average monthly payment for those employed in firms dealing in electricity, gas, steam, and air conditioning supply went up by Sh2,062 to Sh173,103 last year compared to Sh171,041 in 2020.
