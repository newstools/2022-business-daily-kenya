The consortium will be tasked with leading the implementation of the first phase of the project which also involves junction improvement. Under the Sh548 million contract, the consortium will design the project, construct traffic management centre (TMC), provide assistance during bid evaluation, negotiation, supervision of detailed engineering as well as support the preparation of operation and maintenance. Kura director-general Silas Kinoti said that bidding of the main contract which involves the improvement of 21 junctions and construction of a fully-equipped TMC is expected to commence in August 2022. comulo@ke.nationmedia.com
