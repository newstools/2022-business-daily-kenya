PHOTO | DENNIS ONSONGO | NMG Banks have asked the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to approve risk-based lending more broadly, noting the current situation gives little incentive to institutions to expand credit to riskier customers. Kenya scrapped legal controls of credit charges on November 7, 2019. Banks were, however, stopped from re-pricing loans after the CBK stepped in administratively, requiring them to file new formulas for lending that have to be vetted. Six banks have received approvals for risk-based lending and only Equity Bank has come to say it secured regulatory clearance. The average lending rate in the banking sector stands at 12.15 percent, below the rate on risk-free medium-term to long-term government bonds.
