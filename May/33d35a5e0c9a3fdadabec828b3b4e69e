PHOTO | JARED NYATAYA | NMG In the past two months, Kenyans have witnessed intermittent fuel shortages linked to delays in payment of subsidy to oil marketers by the Treasury. Indications in the second supplementary budget estimates that Sh37.8 billion has been set aside to cater for the subsidy until June 30, out of which Sh15.8 billion has already been paid out, are a cause for concern. This is because the oil marketers’ pending claims, and those that will arise out of June subsidies, outstrip the allocated funds. In addition to the risk of the country sliding back to the fuel shortage debacle witnessed between March and earlier this month, oil marketers may also be put out of business, with far-reaching consequences for the economy. In such a case, an inefficient fuel market would arise. It is therefore important that the government keep its end of the bargain, by matching the award of subsidies with actual payment to the marketers, who otherwise risk running out of working capital. The government should also consider forgoing some of the already hefty fuel taxes until the global fuel situation normalises in order to protect the sector from further disruption.
