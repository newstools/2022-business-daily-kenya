In a statement on Tuesday, the firm said Mr Muli will take over from Ms Oduor immediately as she proceeded on annual leave. Mr Muli is an insider who, prior to his appointment, was the acting general manager in charge of regional coordination at the troubled state-owned electricity distributor. He holds Masters of Business Administration (Strategic option) and is currently pursuing a PhD in the same field. “Kenya Power has appointed Eng Geoffrey Waswa Muli as acting managing director with effect from 17th May 2022 in place of Eng Rosemary Oduor, who was serving in an acting capacity,” Kenya Power statement reads. “Eng Oduor is proceeding on a well-deserved annual leave.” Ms Oduor took over from Bernard Ngugi, who also resigned last year in shock changes at the firm. Mr Ngugi was the fourth CEO in four years to exit the firm amid a boardroom fallout that came months after the court dismissed a petition to remove him over past procurement dealings. He had come under pressure from the board and shareholders over turnaround plans amid a streak of losses at the utility. He quit barely two years after he was appointed for a three-year term.

Mr Tarus was charged alongside his predecessor, Ben Chumo, and a number of other senior managers of the power distributor. They have denied all the charges. botieno@ke.nationmedia.com
