FILE PHOTO | NMG The plan by the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife to cap the number of visitors allowed in some national parks and game reserves will help reduce the environmental impact of human activities in the amenities, including pollution. The capping will see Masai Mara, for instance, host a maximum of 32,000 of its carrying capacity visitors even during its peak season of June to October when hotels, lodges and tour operators charge the highest rates. The move will also address concerns of congestion of tourists and safari vehicles in parks and reserves such as Masai Mara, especially during the great wildebeest migration season, threatening wildlife, and reducing the destinations’ international tourism standards and appeal to visitors. The capping is, however, set to raise entry rates during the high season due to demand. In light of this, the ministry should ensure that the measures do not drive away tourists to other alternative destinations such as Serengeti in Tanzania, which offers almost the same experience as the Masai Mara. The government and tour operators should also market other destinations and activities to reduce pressure on a few locations.
