Many organisations struggle to reap the benefits of investments in digital transformation while others see enormous gains. What then do successful firms do differently? As a number grow their technical teams, managers from across the business neither embrace the newly available information nor think much about how data could enhance work. At the same time, their IT teams have little visibility into the business units and hence cannot easily integrate data into operations. Pairing data analysts with business employees who have insight in where improvements in efficiency and performance are needed should be a common practice as innovation rules business environments. To build a companywide digital capability, organisations need to develop capabilities in data management as well as democratising access to data and technology outside traditional tech silos. Companies should train their employees at all levels and in all functions to enable them identify and capitalise on opportunities for incorporating data and technology to improve their work. Digital transformation requires that executives, managers and frontlines employees work together to rethink how every aspect of the business should operate. Many companies underestimate the importance of getting employees to pull transformation into their functions rather than having IT groups push the changes out to the business. Research has shown that companies must create synergies in the areas of capabilities, technology and architecture. These three areas can work together to build what is called tech intensity. Tech intensity is derived from the Economics concept of intensive margin — how much a resource is used or applied. It refers to the extent to which employees put technology to use to drive digital innovation and achieve business outcomes.
