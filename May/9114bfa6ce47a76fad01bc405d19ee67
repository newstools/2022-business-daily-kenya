FILE PHOTO | NMG The African Union (AU), through the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has inked a deal with Singapore to establish a framework for mutual recognition of digital Covid-19 certificates in an effort to aid resumption of travel. In the deal, fully vaccinated African travellers with digital Covid-19 certificates issued by the AU will from May 23, be able to upload and validate their certificates through the Vaccination Check Portal or the Singapore Arrival Card to verify their vaccination status. The exercise will allow them to enter Singapore without quarantine and/or testing under the Vaccinated Travel Framework. The same will be replicated for fully vaccinated Singapore travellers who are in possession of the digital vaccination certificates. To facilitate the seamless exchange of data, Singapore and the African Union will employ the use of standard harmonizing digital passes dubbed Trusted Travel (TT) and Trusted Vaccines (TV). The passes are special purpose tools that give governments and organisations access to a network of platforms for health credential issuance, border risk management, digital public health surveillance, and lab, clinical and vaccination registries. In Kenya, fully vaccinated persons can apply for and download a digital vaccination certificate issued by the ministry of health via portal.health.go.ke.
