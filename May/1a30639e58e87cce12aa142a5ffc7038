The lender’s net profit in the period stood at Sh9.9 billion, up from Sh6.4 billion the year before. Outgoing KCB chief executive Joshua Oigara said the results reflected resilience in a tough environment. “During the quarter, the business showed sustained resilience backed by our proactive approach towards driving income growth, managing liquidity, conservation of capital, and cost containment,” said Mr Oigara. “Furthermore, a relentless focus on our strategy has enabled us to maintain robust asset growth and deliver healthy return on our investments,” said Mr Oigara.

Provisions decreased by 27.5 percent from a similar period last year largely due to a drop in corporate and digital lending impairment charge after Covid-19 related provisions recognised in the full year 2021, said the lender.
