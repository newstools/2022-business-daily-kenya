The new facility in Narok County was acquired from Azure Mara Haven and rebranded as PrideInn Mara Camp. “We are looking into expanding to all 47 counties within Kenya. At the moment, over the next three years, we have highlighted 10 counties where we want to establish our hotels and facilities,” said Hasnain Noorani, Group Managing director PrideInn. The new establishment grows PrideInn’s establishments to seven with room capacity of over 700. In 2020, the hotel chain signed a management contract with Azure, expanding its business beyond owning and running its properties. This saw it rebrand Azure hotel in Westlands to PrideInn Azure.
