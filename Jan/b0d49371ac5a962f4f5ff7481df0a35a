FILE PHOTO | NMG Revelations that Dubai banned flights from Kenya due to fake Covid-19 clearance certificates to travellers should serve as a warning that Kenya could lose strides made in the war on the pandemic. The ban is the latest blow to the struggling aviation industry and even bigger the country’s image in the global war against the pandemic. Dubai says that some 73 cases of Covid-19 negative tests were fake, an alarmingly high number that points to deliberate moves by officials to make quick cash at the expense of Kenya’s image. While it remains to be seen if Dubai will allow flights from Kenya to resume, the two days translate to huge losses for Kenya Airways that banked on the route to raise revenues as part of the turnaround in the post-Covid era. Health Ministry says that it has started a probe into the issue and promised stern action on those found culpable. But this is not enough. Kenyans need to know the faces behind the corrupt issuance of fake Covid-19 clearance certificates and also the action taken. For a country fighting a seemingly losing battle against corruption, the Health Ministry officials should ensure that the unscrupulous officials colluding with members of the public to make a quick money at the expense of the economy are dealt with decisively and fast.
