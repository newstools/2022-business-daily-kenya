According to a police report seen by the Nation, the robbers, armed with a homemade gun, hammer, knives, and a panga, forced their way into the banking hall where they held nine employees hostage before making away with the cash. "CCTV footage showed that a KK security guard on duty, Tobias Juma, opened the main door of the bank for the robbers. After entering the banking hall, they then commandeered the members of staff to the toilets and locked them inside before they ransacked the drawers and stole Sh2.3 million," reads the police report. Filed at the Nakuru Central Police Station, the report indicates that the robbers injured a teller, Meshack Tanui, during the heist. Mr Tanui was later rushed to the Aga Khan Hospital, where he was treated and discharged. Detectives visited the scene on Wednesday evening but were yet to make arrests.
